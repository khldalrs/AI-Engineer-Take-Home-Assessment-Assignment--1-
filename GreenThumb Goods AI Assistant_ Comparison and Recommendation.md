# GreenThumb Goods AI Assistant: Comparison and Recommendation

## Method Comparison

### Fine-Tuning Approach
**Pros:**
- Better consistency in responses once trained
- Lower per-query inference costs
- Can learn company-specific patterns and terminology

**Cons:**
- Higher upfront development cost and time
- Requires retraining when product catalog or policies change
- Less flexible for handling novel query types

### Prompt Engineering Approach
**Pros:**
- Minimal initial setup required
- Easy to update with new products or policies
- More flexible for handling unexpected query types
- Faster implementation and iteration

**Cons:**
- Higher per-query costs due to longer prompts
- Less consistent responses across similar queries
- May struggle with very complex or ambiguous queries

## Recommendation

For GreenThumb Goods, I recommend implementing a **hybrid approach, starting with prompt engineering** as the initial solution:

1. **Begin with prompt engineering** (Strategy A: Zero-shot with detailed context) for immediate deployment
2. **Collect real customer interactions** to build a high-quality dataset
3. **Implement fine-tuning** after 3-6 months once sufficient data is collected
4. **Maintain prompt engineering** for edge cases and when product catalog or policies change

This approach provides the fastest path to implementation while creating a foundation for future improvements. The prompt engineering solution can be deployed immediately with minimal development cost, while the company collects real-world data to inform a more sophisticated fine-tuned model in the future.

## Google Analytics Integration

### Critical Events to Track
1. **complex_query_identified** - When multi-intent queries are detected
2. **product_recommendation_provided** - When products are suggested
3. **policy_information_delivered** - When policy details are shared
4. **user_satisfaction_rating** - Direct feedback on response quality
5. **conversion_after_chat** - When users make purchases after chat interactions

### Analytics-Driven Improvement
If analytics show drop-offs after complex queries:
1. Use **Path Exploration** to identify where users go after receiving responses
2. Create **User Segments** to compare successful vs. abandoned interactions
3. Analyze by query type, device category, and user demographics
4. Use findings to refine prompts or prioritize specific query types for fine-tuning

This data-driven approach ensures continuous improvement of the AI assistant based on real user interactions and business outcomes.
